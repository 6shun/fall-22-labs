# INFO 153A/253A - Front-End Web Architecture - Lab 1
September 2nd, 2022

## Environment Setup
- You can use any IDE for the labs and assignments.
- Do use an IDE and not a text editor like Notepad++. IDEs will make your life a lot easier, especially if you don't have a lot of coding experience.
- The preferred IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). VSCode supports a lot of languages and frameworks, including everything that we would use in this course and has a support for a wide range of extensions that will be helpful.
- We would also need a local javascript runtime later to run React.js and hence we would need to have Node.js and npm installed. Use this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download and install them!

## GitHub
- As you can already see, all the code that is taught during the Friday's lab will be published on GitHub.
- Moreover, you will be using GitHub Classrooms to submit your assignments!
- You can refer to the lab recording on bCourses and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) video in case you need to learn about GitHub from scratch or refresh some of its concepts.
